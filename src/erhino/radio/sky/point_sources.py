"""PointSourceOperator — PLACEHOLDER bright point sources.

Element: "Bright point sources (these are mostly diluted by the beam, but
still there at a low level)".

Real physics to come: a catalogue of bright sources with spectra, entering
through the (sidelobe-weighted) beam as the sky drifts. The placeholder is a
constant low-level contribution.
