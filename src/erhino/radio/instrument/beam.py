"""BeamOperator — PLACEHOLDER beam response.

Real physics to come (port of limTOD's beam handling): a measured or
EM-simulated primary beam convolved with the sky (limTOD does this via
harmonic-space alm rotation, ZYZ Euler convention). This placeholder reduces
the beam to a single coupling factor.
