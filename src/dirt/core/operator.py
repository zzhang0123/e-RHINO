"""Operator: the universal transformation interface.

Everything in dirt follows one contract::

    state_out = operator(state_in)          # State -> State, pure

An operator is an ``equinox.Module``: its array-valued fields are traced
pytree leaves (and therefore differentiable parameters "for free"), while
non-array fields are static configuration. Select the trainable parameters
with the standard Equinox idiom::

    params, static = eqx.partition(op, eqx.is_inexact_array)

Design note: :class:`AbstractOperator` is an *interface* (one abstract
method), not a class hierarchy — there are deliberately no intermediate base
classes. Shared behaviour belongs in helper functions and composition
(:class:`~dirt.core.pipeline.Pipeline`), not inheritance.

    Rules for implementors:
        * Never mutate the input state — return ``state.replace(...)`` /
          ``state.with_data(...)``.
        * Randomness must go through ``subkey, state = state.next_key()`` and
          the *advanced* state must be the one returned.
        * Only structural (shape/dtype) validation inside ``__call__`` —
          value checks would break under jit.
