"""AbstractLinearFilter: the common shape of data filters.

Sidereal-repeat extraction, sky-space (map-making) filtering, and
fringe-rate/delay filtering are all *linear projections* — they differ only
in which subspace they project onto. The base class fixes the shared
semantics; concrete filters implement ``project`` and declare a static
``mode`` field:

    mode="extract" ->  P d        (keep the projected component)
    mode="remove"  ->  d - P d    (subtract it)

Filters are ordinary operators, so analysis chains are ordinary Pipelines —
and because filters are differentiable, the signal loss they induce (the
transfer function) can itself be marginalised in inference later.

Filters typically run on *calibrated* data (see
:class:`~erhino.radio.instrument.calibration.ApplyCalibrationOperator`);
preserve the raw data first with ``SnapshotOperator``.
