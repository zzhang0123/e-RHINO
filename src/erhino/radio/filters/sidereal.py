"""SiderealFilter: project onto the day-repeating (sky-locked) subspace.

Structure that repeats every sidereal day is sky-locked (the drifting sky
through a fixed beam); everything else is instrument/environment. Averaging
the same LST bin across days is the orthogonal projection onto that
subspace — ``extract`` returns the repeating sidereal structure, ``remove``
returns the non-repeating residual.

Run this on *calibrated* data: uncorrected gain drifts are not sky-locked and
would leak into the day-average. Real version: irregular/gapped LST sampling
via binning; the placeholder assumes the time axis is exactly ``n_days``
concatenated identical LST grids (day-major ordering).
