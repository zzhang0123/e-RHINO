"""ForegroundOperator — PLACEHOLDER diffuse foregrounds.

Element: "Multiple diffuse FG components (variable in LST and freq.)".

Real physics to come (port of limTOD's sky handling): foreground maps with
uncertain spectral-index structure (Anstey-style) improved via the moment
expansion — the identified pain point where "reasonable" few-percent models
must reach 0.1% accuracy. The placeholder is a single power law, constant in
time (the real component varies in LST as the Galaxy transits).
