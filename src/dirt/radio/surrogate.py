"""Neural surrogate operators: hybrid physics + ML in the same formalism.

A neural network is just another operator: an ``eqx.nn.MLP``'s weights are
ordinary traced leaves, so :class:`NeuralOperator` plugs into pipelines,
graph assembly, ``build_forward_fn``, gradient calibration, Fisher forecasts,
and the NumPyro bridge exactly like a physical parameter set — no special
machinery anywhere.

:class:`NeuralOperator` learns a positive multiplicative spectral response
``data * exp(MLP(freq))`` — a drop-in surrogate for any smooth
frequency-dependent stage (bandpass, beam chromaticity correction, ...).
It deliberately has NO default graph node: a surrogate's placement is a
modelling decision, so provide it explicitly, e.g.
``At("bandpass", NeuralOperator.create(...))`` to replace the physical
bandpass with a learned one (see ``examples/neural_surrogate.py``).
