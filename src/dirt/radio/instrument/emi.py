"""EMIOperator — PLACEHOLDER self-generated interference.

Element: "Self-generated EMI (e.g. due to power supply fluctuations,
switched-mode power sources and some control signals from the Arduino control
board, Odroid computer, or the SDR itself). Mostly looks like RFI."

Real physics to come: characterised spectral lines of the system's own
electronics (switching harmonics form comb-like structures). The placeholder
adds a constant-amplitude frequency comb.
