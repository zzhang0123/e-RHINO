"""GainOperator — PLACEHOLDER time-dependent gain.

Real physics to come (port of limTOD / hydra-tod gain models): multiplicative
gain g(t) with 1/f flicker fluctuations. The gain is the primary calibration
target — it must stay a differentiable leaf so gradient-based and Bayesian
calibration can infer it.
