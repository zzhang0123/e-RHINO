"""AtmosphericEmissionOperator — PLACEHOLDER beam-averaged atmospheric emission.

The atmosphere enters the graph twice (equivalent-entry pair, like ground
spill):

- ``atmosphere`` (this operator): the beam-averaged *emission* as an additive
  effective temperature — a branch of the antenna-temperature sum, parallel
  to ``ground_pickup`` and ``t_sys_extra``. It sits before the
  ``receiver_input`` switch (calibration loads do not see the sky) and before
  the noise-wave stage (atmospheric emission arrives through the antenna, so
  it suffers the ``(1-|Gamma|^2)`` reflection loss).
- ``atmosphere_field`` (reserved, no shipped operator): strict radiative
  transfer on the astro branch *before* the beam —
  ``e^(-tau sec z) T_sky + T_atm (1 - e^(-tau sec z))`` inside the beam
  integral. Opacity must act on the astro sky alone: applied after the
  antenna-temperature sum it would wrongly attenuate ground pickup, which
  never crosses the atmosphere.

Real physics to come: emission temperature from an atmospheric model
(opacity x ambient temperature, beam-weighted airmass), slowly varying in
time and frequency for a zenith-pointing drift scan.
