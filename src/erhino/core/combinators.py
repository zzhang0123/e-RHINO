"""Combinators: parallel composition of operators.

:class:`~erhino.core.pipeline.Pipeline` composes operators *sequentially*;
:class:`SumOperator` composes them *in parallel*, summing their data
contributions. Together they express the typical structure of a physical
forward model, e.g. an antenna temperature assembled from independent
components::

    astro = Pipeline(
        SumOperator(global_signal, foregrounds, point_sources),
        ionosphere,                       # distorts the astrophysical sum
    )
    t_ant = SumOperator(astro, ground_pickup)

Both combinators are themselves operators, so they nest freely.

    Semantics:
        * Every branch receives the *input* context (coords, env, meta) with
          ``data`` stripped to ``None`` — SumOperator is a *source* combinator
          whose branches each produce their own contribution on the shared
          coordinate grid. A branch that tries to read input data fails
          loudly instead of silently depending on caller state.
        * Branches must not change coords/env/meta; the output state carries
          the input context with ``data = sum(branch outputs)``.
        * PRNG: each branch gets its own subkey split off the main chain, so
          stochastic branches draw independent randomness and a single seed
          reproduces the whole sum. The output state carries the advanced key.

    Example::

        sky = SumOperator(
            GlobalSignalOperator(...), ForegroundOperator(...),
            names=("signal", "foregrounds"),
