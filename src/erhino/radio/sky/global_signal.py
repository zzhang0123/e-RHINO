"""GlobalSignalOperator — PLACEHOLDER 21 cm global signal.

Element: "21cm global signal (roughly const. in LST, smooth in freq.)".

Real physics to come: physical global-signal models (e.g. parametrized
absorption troughs, ARES/21cmFAST-style physical parameters) whose recovery
is the science target. The placeholder is a Gaussian absorption feature —
constant in time, smooth in frequency — with differentiable depth, centre,
and width, so signal-recovery experiments work end-to-end already.
