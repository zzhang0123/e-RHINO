"""SignalGraph: declarative signal-path templates and graph-guided assembly.

The composition of a physical forward model is implicit in its signal path.
A :class:`SignalGraph` records that path once — sources, transforms, and sum
junctions — and :func:`assemble` compiles a *set* of operator instances into
the ordinary ``Pipeline`` / ``SumOperator`` nesting induced by the provided
nodes:

* absent **source** nodes are pruned;
* absent **transform** nodes contract to identity (the signal passes through);
* a **junction** with one live incoming branch passes through, with two or
  more it materializes as a ``SumOperator`` — branch order is the graph's
  edge declaration order, never the call-site order, so the same provided
  set always folds to the same tree (same names, same PRNG stream, same jit
  cache entry).

The result is an :class:`Assembly` — itself an operator — wrapping the folded
composite plus static metadata (which nodes are lit, which were skipped) for
rendering the lit/dim signal-path view. Nothing new exists at runtime: an
Assembly is inspectable, differentiable, and replaceable exactly like the
hand-built composite it compiles to.

Operators declare their home node via the ``graph_node`` ClassVar (resolved
through the MRO, so subclasses inherit it); :class:`At` overrides placement
per instance.
