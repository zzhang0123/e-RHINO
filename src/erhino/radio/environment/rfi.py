"""RFIOperator — PLACEHOLDER radio-frequency interference.

Element: "RFI (very complicated, mix of narrow and wideband signals with
temporal structure on a variety of scales, some bright and some low-level)".
Pain point: "For low-level RFI, we can perhaps consider a stochastic process
model that fits unknown added variance based on night to night variations."

Real physics to come: a stochastic-process model for low-level unflagged RFI
(the hardest pain point — no reasonable model exists yet), plus bright
narrow/wideband transmitters. The placeholder draws a sparse random mask of
constant-amplitude spikes via the State PRNG protocol.
