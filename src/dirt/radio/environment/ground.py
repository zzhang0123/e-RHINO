"""GroundPickupOperator — PLACEHOLDER ground spill-over.

Element: "Ground pickup via the beam sidelobes (depends on ambient
temperature as well)". Pain point: "a simple low-order spatial model might be
worth trying, i.e. use the existing topographic template and allow its
outline and internal structure to be modulated by relatively smooth functions
of alt/az. This will couple into the beam effects however."

Real physics to come: sidelobe-weighted topographic template with smooth
alt/az modulation (coupled to the beam model). The placeholder demonstrates
the *environment coupling contract*: the contribution is
``coupling * T_ambient`` with the ambient temperature read from the traced
``state.env`` when available — exactly why Environment is a traced (and thus
differentiable) part of State.
