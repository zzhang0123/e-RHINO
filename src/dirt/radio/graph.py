"""The canonical single-antenna signal-path graph and graph-guided assembly.

This is the flowchart that makes composition implicit: provide a set of
operators and :func:`assemble` lights up the connected sub-path they induce
and compiles it to the equivalent ``Pipeline``/``SumOperator`` nesting::

    from dirt.radio.graph import assemble

    twin = assemble(GlobalSignalOperator(...), ForegroundOperator(...),
                    BeamOperator(...), GainOperator(...))
    print(twin)                # lit nodes + skipped-as-identity nodes
    print(twin.to_mermaid())   # lit/dim signal-path rendering

Topology (v1.1; sum junctions marked ``(+)``)::

    global_signal | foregrounds | point_sources | uniform_sky
        -> (+) astro_sum -> ionosphere ------------\\
    ground_field* | rfi_field --------------------> (+) field_sum -> beam --\\
    observed_astro_sky | ground_pickup | t_sys_extra* -----------------------> (+) t_ant_sum
        -> atmosphere -> (SW) receiver_input <- cal_loads
        -> noise_wave -> cw_tone -> bandpass -> gain
        -> noise -> emi -> adc
        -> flagging -> averaging -> apply_cal -> filters      [processing segment]

Equivalent-entry leaves (the ``*`` nodes are reserved placeholders with no
shipped operator yet): the same physical effect may enter at different
stages in different forms — ground spill either as a *field* before the beam
(``ground_field``, to be convolved) or as an *effective temperature* after it
(``ground_pickup`` / generic ``t_sys_extra``); the whole astro path either as
component fields through the shared ``beam`` node or pre-convolved via
``observed_astro_sky`` (``SkySourceOperator``). Provide whichever form you
have; the graph keeps both entrances.

Switched calibration loads (elements taxonomy "calibration signals ...
switched in and out on a pre-defined cycle") enter through the
``receiver_input`` *selector* node: with only the antenna chain provided it
passes through; provide ``CalLoadOperator`` too and each time sample takes
the branch chosen by ``coords.extra["receiver_input"]`` (0 = antenna,
1 = load — the edge declaration order).

The forward physical chain ends at ``adc`` (the raw waterfall); the
processing segment (flagging/averaging/apply_cal/filters) is data-side and
applies identically to simulated and observed raw data.
