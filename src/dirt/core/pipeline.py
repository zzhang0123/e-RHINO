"""Pipeline: ordered composition of operators — itself an operator.

Because Pipeline satisfies the same ``State -> State`` contract as any other
operator, pipelines nest freely (composite pattern)::

    instrument = Pipeline(beam, receiver, names=("beam", "rx"))
    full = Pipeline(sky, instrument, backend)

Execution is a plain Python loop over heterogeneous stages: under ``jax.jit``
this unrolls into one fused computation, which is exactly right when every
stage is a different operator. (A ``lax.scan`` over a *homogeneous* stack of
identical operators is a different, complementary pattern — deliberately not
built here.)
