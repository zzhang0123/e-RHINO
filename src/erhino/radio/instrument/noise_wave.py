"""NoiseWaveOperator — PLACEHOLDER receiver noise-wave / reflection terms.

Elements: "Reflections and bandpass shape ... includes the noise wave Gamma
parameters. Antenna also produces significant reflection term" and
"Noise-wave reflection terms (the noise-wave T parameters; expected to be
relatively smooth in LST and frequency)".

Real physics to come (noise-wave GCR draft, Eq. 1): the measured power of a
source with noise temperature ``T_src`` and reflection coefficient
``Gamma_src`` is::

    P = g * ( T_src (1-|G|^2) |F|^2 + T_unc |G|^2 |F|^2
              + T_cos Re(G F) + T_sin Im(G F) + T_0 )

with ``F = sqrt(1-|G_rec|^2) / (1 - G G_rec)``. The placeholder implements
the ``F -> 1`` limit with a real/imaginary reflection pair, preserving the
property that matters for calibration: the output is *linear* in the
noise-wave vector ``t_nw = (T_unc, T_cos, T_sin)`` — the ``d = H t_nw``
structure that Gaussian Constrained Realisation sampling relies on (draft
Eqs. 20, 24, 28; ``g`` and ``T_0`` are common to all PSD measurements and
cancel in the quotient construction, so ``T_0`` is not a column of ``H`` —
though the operator output happens to be linear in ``T_0`` as well).
