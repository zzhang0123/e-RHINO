"""Environment: traced environmental telemetry riding along with a State.

These fields typically do NOT enter the forward model — they are preserved for
diagnostics, correlation studies, sensitivity analysis and reproducibility.
Because they are traced pytree leaves (not static), they can also be promoted
into the forward model later (e.g. temperature-dependent gain) without any
structural change.

Non-numeric descriptors (weather strings, site names...) belong in
``State.meta``, not here.
