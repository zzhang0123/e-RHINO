"""ADCOperator — PLACEHOLDER digitization.

Real physics to come: true quantization (round to 2**n_bits levels) has zero
gradient almost everywhere, so the differentiable version will need a
straight-through estimator (identity gradient through the rounding) or a
smooth surrogate. This placeholder applies scale + clip, which is
differentiable almost everywhere and preserves the saturation behaviour.
