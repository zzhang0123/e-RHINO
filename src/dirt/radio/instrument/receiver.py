"""Receiver bandpass — PLACEHOLDER.

Real physics to come: frequency-dependent bandpass, and eventually
reflection/impedance-mismatch effects along the signal chain. Sky-side
additive temperatures (atmosphere, ground spill) are *not* receiver
business — they are branches of the antenna-temperature sum
(:class:`~dirt.radio.environment.atmosphere.AtmosphericEmissionOperator`,
:class:`~dirt.radio.environment.ground.GroundPickupOperator`), entering
before the reflection/noise-wave terms and therefore seeing the
``(1-|Gamma|^2)`` loss. The receiver temperature itself enters after the
reflection, as the noise-wave ``T_0`` (see
:class:`~dirt.radio.instrument.noise_wave.NoiseWaveOperator`) and the
post-gain thermal noise ``T_n``.
