"""Turn a Pipeline into a parametric forward function for inference.

This is the seam between forward modelling and inference: the pipeline stays a
clean instrument description, and inference engines (gradient calibrators,
NumPyro, future neural surrogates) see only ``f(params) -> prediction``.

The mechanism is the standard Equinox partition/combine idiom::

    params, static = eqx.partition(pipeline, filter_spec)
    prediction = eqx.combine(params, static)(state_template).data

        pipeline: any operator (usually a Pipeline) describing the forward model.
        state_template: the input state the forward model is evaluated on
            (coordinates, PRNG key, metadata...). Closed over, held fixed.
        filter_spec: which pipeline leaves are trainable parameters. Default:
            every inexact (floating-point) array. Pass a pytree-of-bools (e.g.
            built with ``jax.tree.map(lambda _: False, pipeline)`` +
